# ResNetCAM-keras
Keras implementation of a ResNet-CAM model with Keras

## Motivation

The original Matlab implementation and paper (for AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGG16) can be found [here](https://github.com/metalbubble/CAM).  A Keras implementation of VGG-CAM can be found [here](https://github.com/tdeboissiere/VGG16CAM-keras/blob/master/README.md).

This implementation is also in Keras and uses ResNet-50, which was __not__ explored in the original paper.  

## Requirements

- keras with tensorflow backend (keras version 2.0.0 or later)
- numpy
- ast
- scipy
- matplotlib
- opencv3

## Usage

coming soon :) -- for now, see the ipython notebook

## Example plot

coming soon!
